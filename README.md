## Objective
I‚Äôm a recent computer science graduate with a strong interest in cybersecurity and hands-on experience in configuring VPNs, firewalls, DNS sinkholes, and intrusion detection systems. I'm currently seeking an entry-level role in IT or cybersecurity where I can contribute to system security, network management, or technical support while continuing to grow my skills in real-world environments.

## Tools


### Network
- WireGuard (for creating encrypted VPN tunnels)
- UFW (for configuring firewall rules and traffic filtering)
- BIND9 (for managing DNS resolution and creating sinkholes)
- dig (for testing DNS responses)
- Wireshark (for monitoring and analyzing network traffic)
- Snort (for real-time network intrusion detection)
- curl (for testing HTTP traffic and DNS leaks)
- ping (for testing connectivity)

### System/Endpoint
- SSH (for secure remote access to servers)
- Ubuntu Server/DigitalOcean VPS (for hosting all self-managed services)
- Homebrew (for managing software installations on macOS)

### Security/Monitoring
- Snort (for detecting suspicious/unauthorized packets)
- BIND9 logging (for observing DNS query patterns)
- iptables logging (for packet filtering and auditing)

## Certifications
- CodePath Intermediate iOS Development ‚Äì Spring 2023
- CompTIA Network+ (In progress)

## Projects
### üîê [Homemade VPN](https://github.com/rgutierrezz/homemade-vpn)
A secure, self-hosted VPN built using WireGuard on a cloud-based Ubuntu VPS.

- Configured WireGuard for encrypted tunneling of internet traffic
- Enabled IP forwarding and NAT using `iptables`
- Generated and managed cryptographic key pairs for client-server authentication
- Troubleshooted DNS and routing issues post-deployment
- Verified anonymity using `curl` and DNS leak checks

---

### üî• [UFW Firewall Setup](https://github.com/rgutierrezz/homemade-firewall)
Configured a firewall using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on a Linux VPS.

- Enabled default-deny policy with explicit allow rules for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS
- Secured remote server access while ensuring web availability
- Tested access rules and verified port restrictions using browser and CLI tools

---

### üõ°Ô∏è [DNS Sinkhole](https://github.com/rgutierrezz/dns-sinkhole)
Set up a DNS sinkhole using BIND9 to block malicious domains.

- Configured a recursive DNS server to intercept and redirect queries
- Created a zone file to sinkhole `badsite.com` and redirect it to `0.0.0.0`
- Verified sinkhole success with `dig` and browser testing

---

### üëÅÔ∏è [Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](https://github.com/rgutierrezz/snort-ids)
Deployed Snort 3 on macOS to monitor and log suspicious network traffic.

- Installed Snort using Homebrew and created a basic ICMP detection rule
- Captured ping traffic using `ping` and verified alerts in real time
- Parsed and interpreted Snort logs to confirm packet detection accuracy
